"""Every screen renders, and nothing throws doing it.

The narrowest useful question this tier can ask, and the one nothing else in
the suite can: the route tests prove the API answers, but a screen whose
renderer throws on load, or paints an empty shell over a good response, returns
200 for every request it makes and looks perfect from the server's side.

Two assertions per screen, and the second is the one that finds things: the
screen has content, *and* the page recorded no uncaught error or rejection
while producing it. A `.catch` that swallows a real failure still shows up
here, because the screen it was supposed to fill stays empty.
